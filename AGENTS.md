# AchBot repository rules

- This is a public repository: never commit customer data, deployment secrets, raw SQL dumps, runtime backups or logs.
- Phase 1 is strictly a behavior-preserving PHP refactor over the unchanged legacy MariaDB schema. DO NOT change the DB, run migrations or alter observable admin/customer behavior.
- Preserve current webhook, payment/subscription, Telegram callback-data and Cron file-path contracts until validated compatibility adapters exist.
- Keep local `baseInfo.php` untouched and excluded from Git; any evaluation of changes to its structure belongs to the LAST refactor increment.
- Build characterization tests and compare old vs new database side effects, external calls and messages before changing a high-risk flow.
- Keep small independent deliverable stages with targeted tests, required exact-candidate review and explicit operator test acceptance before starting the next stage.
- For ambiguous bugs, preserve current behavior; track a fix independently rather than silently changing it.
- Use AchBot naming for new internal structures. Do not mass-replace legacy `wizwiz` literals used in persisted Telegram callbacks or existing scheduled paths.
- Source of truth is code, issues, CI, project spec and verified environment; do not rely on ChatGPT memory.
